## Preparation

The repository consists of two directories with the materials, installation instructions, theory and practical information.

* [Optical](Optical/README.md)
* [SAR](SAR/README.md)

The repository can be synchronized using `git pull` or downloaded as a zip file. The data used for the practical exercise can be downloaded from [Copernicus.eu](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus) or using the following [link](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mracic_fgg_uni-lj_si/EozeUw9q_HxNlho66hXlpYkBh9T4z7FtVFoz0clv84EyGA?e=Zni0hz). 

Each practical has corresponding install instructions which should be completed in advance.
