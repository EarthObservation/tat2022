## Installation instructions
Software used for the exercise is provided by [STEP](https://step.esa.int/main/) by ESA. The latest version can be downloaded through the [website](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/). For the practicals we will require the Sentinel Toolboxes from the site.

## Sample data
The Sentinel-1 data is available for download at [Copernicus.eu](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus). For this example we will be using two images:
```
S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20220223T165159_20220223T165224_042043_050215_5E8B
S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20220729T165206_20220729T165231_044318_0549FD_B49C

## Additional reasources
This tutorial is based on the [materials](http://step.esa.int/docs/tutorials/S1TBX%20Landcover%20classification%20with%20Sentinel-1%20GRD.pdf) provided by ESA. Where you can find additional information and a classification example for SAR imagery.
